#### Description

Adjectives typically modify nouns. In Irish, the adjective follows the noun, and agrees in number, gender and case.
The lenition that is added to the Irish adjective in the nominative and genitive cases works in a binary fashion*

* Nominative: masc X [no change], fem ✓ [add lenition]
* Genitive: masc ✓ [add lenition], fem X [no change]

#### Examples of <u>feminine noun + adj pairs</u>; nominative case.

* _lacha_ <b>_bhuí_</b>  "a yellow duck"   
* _obair_ <b>_theicniúil_</b>  "technical work"   

#### Examples of <u>masculine noun + adj pairs</u>; nominative case.

* _múinteoir_ <b>_maith_</b> "a good teacher"
* _bia_ <b>_blasta_</b> "tasty food"

#### Examples of feminine noun + adj pairs; genitive case.

* _sciathán_ _na_ _lachan_ <b>_buí_</b> "the yellow duck's wing"
* _tús_ _na_ _hoibre_ <b>_teicniúla_</b> "the beginning of the technical work"

#### Examples of masculine noun + adj pairs; genitive case.

* _bord_ _an_ _mhúinteora_ <b>_mhaith_</b> "the good teacher's table"
* _blas_ _an_ _bhia_ <b>_bhlasta_</b> "the taste of the tasty food"

#### Examples of feminine and masculine noun + adj pairs; dative case**

* _ar_ _an_ _lacha_ <b>_bhuí_</b> "on the yellow duck"
* _san_ _obair_ <b>_theicniúil_</b> "in the technical work"
* _le_ _múinteoir_ <b>_maith_</b> "with a good teacher"
* _faoi_ _bhia_ <b>_bhlasta_</b> "about tasty food"

*It should be noted that adjectives starting with the following letters are not lenited in Irish:
a, e, h, i, j, k, l, n, o, q, r, u, v, w, x, y, z; nor can adjectives beginning with sc, sf, sm, sp, st, or sv be lenited.
The remainder can be lenited.

**The Irish dative case no longer exists in full. The dative case has been simplified to a preposition + nominative-noun
structure in the central variety of the language. It should be noted that particular dative forms are still used 
—some more frequently in certain dialects than others, but most are not— and that some dialects inflect the noun
and adjective differently to the central variety of the language described above.

***Irish adjectives come in three declensions, each of which describes certain rules about how the adjective declines
to agree with the noun's number gender and case. e.g. The adj "deas" (nice) in the following examples:
"bia <b>deas</b>" (nice food), and "blas an bhia <b>dheis</b>" (the nice food's taste).
